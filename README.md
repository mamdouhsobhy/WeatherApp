# CirclePay Sdk
I used the following technologies to make that sdk :
## Technology 
used [Dagger Hilt, coroutines, clean architecture, Mvvm, StateFlow, clean code,  Glide,Retrofit,Shimmer for loading and more..]



# Screenshots Soon ......

## Built With

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) - As a programming language.
* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - For multithreading while handling requests to the server and local database.
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java
* [Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM)](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) - Offers an implementation of observer design pattern.
* [StateFlow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-state-flow/) - notifies views of any database changes in an observer way.
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - It is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
* [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - It is arguably the most used Dependency Injection, or DI, framework for Android. Many Android projects use Dagger to simplify building and providing dependencies across the app. It gives you the ability to create specific scopes, modules, and components, where each forms a piece of a puzzle: The dependency graph.
* [Clean Architecture](https://www.raywenderlich.com/3595916-clean-architecture-tutorial-for-android-getting-started) - Applying Clean Architecture and Solid Principles to build a robust, maintainable, and testable application.
