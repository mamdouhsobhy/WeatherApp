I used the following technologies to make that task :
## Technology 
used [Dagger Hilt, coroutines, clean architecture, Mvvm, StateFlow, clean code ,Retrofit]

## Built With

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) - As a programming language.
* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - For multithreading while handling requests to the server and local database.
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java
* [Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM)](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) - Offers an implementation of observer design pattern.
* [StateFlow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-state-flow/) - notifies views of any database changes in an observer way.
* [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - It is arguably the most used Dependency Injection, or DI, framework for Android. Many Android projects use Dagger to simplify building and providing dependencies across the app. It gives you the ability to create specific scopes, modules, and components, where each forms a piece of a puzzle: The dependency graph.
* [Clean Architecture](https://www.raywenderlich.com/3595916-clean-architecture-tutorial-for-android-getting-started) - Applying Clean Architecture and Solid Principles to build a robust, maintainable, and testable application.
